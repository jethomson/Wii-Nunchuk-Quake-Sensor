   This program enables a teensy to act as a USB adapter for a Wii Nunchuk.
   It reports itself as an HID joystick and outputs only the accelerometer
   data from the Wii Nunchuk to the host computer. The nunchuk data is filtered
   with a chebyshev lowpass filter. This program is based on the LUFA Joystick demo
   by Dean Camera and uses the TWI library by Peter Fleury. Attributions and

/* ------ NOTES ------
 * Genuine and fake nunchuks were both tested. The genuine nunchuks use an
 * accelerometer from STMicroelectronics and the fakes use an accelerometer with
 * the markings 6331 over QS***, where the asterisks stand in for a three letter
 * code.
 *
 * The STMicroelectronics based nunchuks work at 100 and 200 kHz and require a
 * delay between reading out data and requesting new data.

 * The 6331 based nunchuks work at 100, 200, and 400 kHz, don't require a delay
 * between reading out data and requesting new data, and can be read from more
 * frequently. However, the accelerometer data in 6331 based nunchuks have some
 * bits that are permanently fixed (i.e. stuck at 0 or 1). Bit 0 of byte 2 is
 * always zero, bit 0 of byte 3 is always one, and bit 0 of byte 4 is always
 * zero. Bits 3, 4, and 5 of byte 5 are also stuck at zero.
 * See the article at:
 * http://jethomson.wordpress.com/2012/04/29/fake-wii-nunchuks-with-a-6331-accelerometer/
 *
 * This code checks the nunchuk's identification bytes and only works with 
 * genuine nunchuks.
 *
 * To prevent aliasing the nunchuk uses an anti-aliasing filter on each of the
 * accelerometer's axes before the nunchuk's internal microcontroller samples
 * them. The anti-aliasing filters have a cut-off frequency of about 60 Hz.
 * Therefore the teensy should take at least 120 readings (samples) a second 
 * from the nunchuk, where each reading contains the data for all three axes
 * of the accelerometer. The USB polling frequency is 125 Hz, so oversampling
 * won't help with visual interpretion the data.
